    '''
        Approach 1: Using HashMap/Dictionary
        Time Complexity: O(n) for traversing the array and O(nlogn) for sorting the result.
        Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the count of each element in the dictionary.
        
            Function to find the majority elements in the array
            The majority element is the element that appears more than n/3 times in the array.
            The function returns a list of all such elements in sorted order.

            The function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
            It then iterates through the dictionary to find elements that appear more than n/3 times.
            Finally, it sorts the result and returns it.
            The function handles the case where the input array is empty by returning an empty list.
            The function also handles the case where there are no majority elements by returning an empty list.
            The function uses a dictionary to store the count of each element in the array.

        Approach 2: Using Boyer-Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm
        Time Complexity: O(n) for traversing the array and O(1) for sorting the result.
        Space Complexity: O(1) for storing the count of each element in the hashmap.

            Function to find the majority elements in the array
            The majority element is the element that appears more than n/3 times in the array.
            The function returns a list of all such elements in sorted order.
            
            The function uses Boyer-Moore's Voting Algorithm to find the majority elements in the array.
            It maintains two candidates and their counts, and iterates through the array to find the majority elements.
            Finally, it checks the counts of the candidates to determine if they are majority elements.
            The function handles the case where the input array is empty by returning an empty list.
            The function also handles the case where there are no majority elements by returning an empty list.
            The function uses two variables to store the candidates and their counts.
